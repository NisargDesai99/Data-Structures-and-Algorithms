## Red Black Binary Search Tree

My own implementation of a Red Black Binary Search Tree.

A Red Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. Meaning that the height of the tree is controlled using rotation and recolorations. This in turn makes searching faster since the search does not have to go as deep into the tree as it would in a normal Binary Search Tree.

To run this program:

1. Download this project
2. Open Terminal/Command Line
3. Change directory to this project
4. javac Main.java
5. Create an input.txt file using the format shown in the example input files.
6. java Main input.txt output.txt
7. Open output.txt to see results
