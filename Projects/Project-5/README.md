# Project 5 - Quicksort

Project Objective: Write a java program to sort a list of integers using ‘in place’ Quicksort algorithm

Sort using the following types of pivots:

* First element as pivot
* Randomly choosing the pivot element
* Choosing the median of 3 randomly chosen lements as the pivot
* Median of first center and last element (book technique).

Record the sorting times for array sizes: 100, 1000, 5000, 10000 and 50000

After sorting, output the sorted and unsorted arrays to an output file.
